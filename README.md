# CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION-MODEL

What is Customer Churn? 
Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame.




Why is Customer Churn Important? 
A natural process of businesses is that customers will come and go but not all customers are here to stay. Managing and reducing churn rate is important because it costs much more to acquire new customers than it does to retain existing customers.
